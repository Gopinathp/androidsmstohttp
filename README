Very basic Android sample application which process incoming sms in an Android phone and sends the text as a HTTP post message to a URL. This app uses the IntentService for delegating the SMS processing action instead of blocking the SMS receiver component.

This app does not have any meaningful UI.

You can test the app by changing the  url in sendToRegistrationServer() method inside the SmsProcessor.java
and you will see that the incoming sms will be delivered on that url in mb and ms GET parameters.
